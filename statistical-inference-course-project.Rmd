## Part 1: Simulation Excercise

In this project, I investigate the exponential distribution in R and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem. Let's start with a sample of the exponential distribution:

```{r}
n <- 1000
lambda <- 0.2
sim <- rexp(n, lambda)
plot(sim)
```

What a mess! Let's clean that up a bit... what would, say, the distribution of averages of 40 exponentials look like?

```{r}
bin.size <- 40
sim.means <- apply(replicate(n / bin.size, sample(sim, size = bin.size)), 2, mean)
plot(sim.means)
```

Nice! We could also look at the distribution...

```{r}
hist(sim.means, breaks = 20, main = 'Distribution of means of 40 exponentials')
```

Let's calculate some simple statistics... say...

### Sample mean and theoretical mean

```{r}
sample.mean <- mean(sim.means)
theoretical.mean <- 1/lambda

abline(v=sample.mean, col='blue')
abline(v=theoretical.mean, col='red')
legend("topright", c("Sample mean", "Theoretical mean"), fill=c("blue", "red"))
```

The sample mean is `r sample.mean` and the theoretical mean is `r theoretical.mean`. The difference is `r theoretical.mean - sample.mean`



```{r}
print('The mean is: ' & mean(sim.means))
print('The standard deviation is: ' + sd(sim))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
